Is it better practice to have one gitignore at the top level? Or separate ones for separate things 

---

_**Agent (model default, mode Agent)**_

Both approaches are valid; choose based on project layout and tooling.

When a single top-level `.gitignore` is better:
- One app/repo root with mostly homogeneous tech stack.
- Simple to audit and avoids duplicated or conflicting rules.
- Easier for CI and new contributors—one place to adjust ignores.
- You can scope rules with subpaths (e.g., `frontend/dist/`, `backend/.env`).

When multiple `.gitignore` files help:
- Monorepo or clearly separated packages where each has distinct tooling outputs (e.g., `frontend/.gitignore` for React build artifacts, `backend/.gitignore` for Python venv).
- Third-party code or templates vendored into subdirectories that need specific ignore rules local to that subtree.
- Keeps package-specific ignores close to their code, reducing root clutter.

Practical guidance:
- Default to a concise root `.gitignore` with project-wide patterns. Use path scoping for clarity.
- Add subdirectory `.gitignore` files only when a package has unique ignores or when a vendor/third-party subtree needs its own rules.
- Avoid duplicated patterns in multiple locations; prefer the root with scoped paths.
- Be explicit with paths to prevent accidental over-ignoring (e.g., `frontend/.next/` instead of `.next/` if only in that subtree).

Do you need to hide firestore.rules and firestore.indexes.json from git? 

---

_**Agent (model default, mode Agent)**_

Generally, keep both in git:

- `firestore.rules`: should be versioned—critical auth/data logic; CI/CD deploys rely on it.
- `firestore.indexes.json`: also versioned—captures required indexes; prevents missing-index errors in new envs.

Only ignore them if you generate environment-specific variants you shouldn’t share (rare). In normal cases, track both.
